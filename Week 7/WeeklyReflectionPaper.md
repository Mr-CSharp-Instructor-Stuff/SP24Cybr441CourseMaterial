# Description
This is the Reflection Paper prompt for Week [N]. Please reflect about this weeks class. This is meant as a freeform journaling excersise to reflect on your week "in the office" to discuss with your next 1-on-1 with your "manager".

### Potential Prompts (pick at least one)
1. Did you read any of the white papers this manager gave to you for this week? (it's Okay if you didn't). If you did, what are your thoughts on the paper was it helpful in any way? Elaborate.
2. What is the current status of your team's project? Is there any roadblocks that would be helpful to address.
3. Did you find any resources that helped you this week to understand the Artificial Intelligence interactions that you and your fellow team members are building?
